The UAV payload will be instrumentation to continuously measure temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction as the UAV spirals vertically from 300 ft agl to 3000 ft agl and back down to 300 ft agl.  The UAV will maintain a GPS controlled circle with a 1500 ft diameter utilizing a Micropilot 1028 autopilot.  The climb rate will be 150 ft/min and the duration of the flight will be approximately 40 min. This system will replace the release of helium filled balloons with radio equipped weather packages and the use of tethered blimps utilized to lift weather instrumentation into the lower atmosphere.   An UAV mounted system is superior because the helium filled free flying balloons rise through the lower 3000 ft of the atmosphere too quickly for accurate weather data.  The tethered blimps have a FAA imposed altitude restriction of 1000-1500 ft due to their danger to aircraft and the inability of the operators to react quickly enough to avoid full scale aircraft.  In contrast, a UAV mounted system can spiral up to 3000 ft in a relatively short time period, yielding high quality weather measurements and can quickly be diverted to avoid full scale aircraft which enter into the area of UAV flights.</p><p> <b>Effective Dates:</b> 3/1/2010-2/28/2011</p><p> <b>Comments:</b> </p><p><b>Link to Records:</b> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/cornell-university-drone-records\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eff.org/document/cornell-university-drone-records</a></p> </div></div>",

This requires the system to transit from 0 - 1200 ft within the class D airspace and into the R5306C restricted airspace in order to properly train squadron aircrews in the effective employment of the new system and to transit to the other adjoining restricted airspace. VMU-2 will fly an average of three (3) to four (4) training flights per day while conducting operations out of MCALF Bogue.  All flights will strictly adhere to a pre-established UAV pattern within the lateral confines of the Class D airspace while using a ground/tower observer until established in the R5306C restricted airspace.

The Government also purchased a perpetual restrictive easement in approximately 125,000 acres of land, commonly referred to as the “buffer zone,” surrounding the test facility and extending about six miles in all directions. Although most of the buffer zone is privately owned, the area is uninhabited because the Government’s easement prohibits habitable structures, including mobile homes, campers, trailers or other enclosed structures. However, the easement does not prohibit landowners from using lands within the buffer zone for activities that do not violate the easement restriction, such as timber production, grazing, haying, agriculture, fishing ponds, mineral extraction, and recreational activities. A consent agreement between NASA and the Pearl River Basin Development District allows temporary camping for the public benefit at McLeod Water Park. The agreement permits transient camping at the Park for a period not to exceed 14 consecutive days (see \"COA_SPECIAL_CIRCUM_DOC.pdf\")</p><p><b>Link to Records:</b> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eff.org/document/air-force-2011</a></p> </div></div>",

Operation of a Honeywell MAV in class G airspace at or below 400 feet AGL.  The operation will launch, operate and recover within the fenced in boundries of an abandoned group of buildings located in the Everglades. The flights will occur in day VFR conditions for the purpose of training and testing the MAV to develop safety and operations procedures. COA for 2011-ESA-4: Due to the nature of its intended use the Miami-Dade Police Department is requesting the ability to utilize the Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) up to and including 300' AGL in .  This would enable the MAV to show an aerial view of most residences from overhead.  It would enable the on scene tactical commander to view all four sides of a structure in real time and allow him to make decisions based on this information.  This would increase his situational awareness and safety to officers while reducing radio transmissions.  This altitude would also avoid any potential conflicts by providing a level of separation between the MAV and other Air Traffic. The pilot and/or Observer are to maintain line of sight contact and visual observation of the MAV while in flight and remain within 2000 feet laterally of the MAV.  The request for this increased distance is that the MAV Program was intended in situations where a subject was either known or suspected to be in possession of a long gun where utilization of traditional aviation assets would pose an increased risk to the aircrew and aircraft.  This distance is easily achievable by a skilled gunman with a rifle and/or a scope but would give the aircrew additional flexibility in site selection.  In urban areas this additional distance would not be necessary but with some of the more rural areas of MDC the added distance would provide more options for the MAV crew.   The MAV will not be intentionally flown over non-hostile personnel or vehicles, nor used in vehicle pursuits or operated from a moving vehicle and/or aircraft.</p><p> <b>Effective Dates:</b> 2011-ESA-56: 9/23/2011-9/22/2012 2011-ESA-4: 7/1/2011-6/30/2012 (but it looks like Miami-Dade has had COAs since at least 2008)</p><p> <b>Comments:</b> The \"COA Status Document\" for notes that \"This COA is for training and testing of pilots and UAS at the designated operations training area only.
